## My process

- First I used CSS to create the div 'card' and display that.  I then fixed the width and height relative to the window, and set min and max widths.
-Then I set about the content of the card.  I added the image and shaped it, then added the button.
-I used a grid to organise the content of the 'plan' box.
-I kept this in CSS rather than using Bootstrap, to really work on my CSS basics.  I plan to also try creating this using Bootstrap.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
<!-- - Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->


<!-- ### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->


### Continued development

I'm planning to keep adjusting the spacing, and create a mobile layout.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - I use this site a lot, and the CSS resources are particularly clear.  I used this to help with the grid layout, and also fixing the position of the card relative to the parent window.
